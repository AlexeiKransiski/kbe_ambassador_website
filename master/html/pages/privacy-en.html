  <h2>Kadho Inc. <i>Privacy Policy</i></h2>

  <p>
    Kadho, Inc. is committed to protecting the privacy of everyone registered to use its website and mobile App and providing a safe and secure user experience.
    The following Privacy Policy is part of Kadho’s Terms of Service  and applies to the use of Kadho online at Kadho.com and on mobile devices.
    This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, secure, and share information pertaining to our users and any other individuals who purchase Kadho’s products.
  </p>

  <h3>1. Information Collection and Protection</h3>
  <p>
    Kadho is designed for the benefit of both adults and children. Although Kadho’s audience mainly consists of children up to the age of 7, a primary purpose of the Kadho’s site is to enable parents to monitor their children’s game performance and activity. Thus the site is designed to protect the privacy and personal data of both parents and children.
  </p>
  <p>
    Kadho requires that parents or guardians of children create an account for each user. Parents or guardians are the “account holder” for Kadho’s products and services. The account holder’s child or children will have a “nickname” for the purpose of protecting the child’s identity. When parents or guardians sign up for Kadho, they are required to submit certain information about themselves and the child (“Account Information”): account holder’s name, age, and email address; and the child’s “nickname”, gender, and month and year of birth.
  </p>
  <p>
    The only personal information obtained from Kadho’s mobile App or website is from parents when registering. The Kadho site is password protected and accessible only to registered members. Children cannot communicate with anyone using Kadho’s mobile Apps nor can they send any personal information using Kadho.
  </p>
  <p>
    Kadho does not collect personal information from children without parental consent. Furthermore, Kadho will never sell user’s personal information to third-parties. In addition, participation in or access to Kadho’s App is not conditional on a child providing more information than is reasonably necessary for use of the App.
  </p>

  </p>

  <h3>3. Disclosure of Information</h3>

  <p>
    Kadho will not provide any personal information to third-parties for marketing purposes. Kadho and third-parties may use Kadho’s aggregate data, not including any personal information, for analytical purposes.

  </p>
  <p>
    Personal information of account holders and users, however, will not be divulged to third-parties for any purposes without the consent of account holders. If account holders agree to participate in a Kadho sponsored or authorized research project, personal information may be released under specified terms and conditions. Third-parties or entities involved in research projects also will have to handle all information from Kadho’s account holders and users in ways that comply with Kadho’s Privacy Policy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Kadho may be required to disclose information obtained from account holders to comply with law enforcement requests, subpoenas, court orders or other legal requests that are verified by Kadho.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the event that Kadho plans to sell all or any part of its business, transfer or merge assets or in the event of bankruptcy, users will be notified so that they can make decisions about removal or deletion of their personal information.

    Account holders can access, review and correct registration and other information in Kadho collected about them by either logging into their account or by contacting Kadho directly.

  </p>

  <h3>5. Changes of Privacy Policy</h3>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated or modified from time to time. In the event that Kadho plans to make any material changes in its Privacy Policy, account holders will be notified of the proposed changes 45 days in advance of these changes and will have the opportunity to respond. Continued use of Kadho after that period will constitute consent to the proposed Privacy Policy changes.
